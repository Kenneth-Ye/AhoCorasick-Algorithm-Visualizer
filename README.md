# AhoCorasick Algorithm Visualizer

This project was built to make it easier for students to understand how the Aho-Corasick algorithm works. This algorithm is used in the linux command fgrep.

## Usage

You can edit the patterns (substrings) to be searched for in the top left. You can also edit the mainstring that the program will be searching for the substring in on the top right. When you are done click the Search and Visualize button to see the animation of the algorithm.
